WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.6

* Complete redesign of the build system and compatibility improvements for
  various OS, including: BSD (FreeBSD), GNU/Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), macOS, 
  MinGW/MSYS (i.e. DreamSDK), MinGW-w64/MSYS2 and Cygwin. The build system is
  now shared between dcload-ip and dcload-serial. [SiZiOUS]
* Various improvements on the GDB remote debugging feature. [SiZiOUS]
* Some minor fixes. [SiZiOUS]

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.5

* Some fixes.
* No one ever really documented the changes from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5.

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.4

* added 500000 and 1500000 baud for linux systems using ftdi ft232bm
  (6.144mhz crystal) based usb-serial coders cables. under ms windows/cygwin
  with the appropriate virtual comport drivers (vcp)
  http://www.ftdichip.com/ftdriver.htm
  a typical dc-tool command line under *nix might look
  like this: (In this case under a linux 2.6 kernel)
    dc-tool -t /dev/usb/tts/0 -b 1500000 -x <sh4exefile>
  the usb device under linux seems to vary by version and distribution so
  you will have to experiment and watch the system log files if you use a
  usb-serial codes cable.
* serial protocol for uints now forces little-endian byte order. dc-tool
  should work on a Mac now.
* increased the compression buffer size in dc-tool from 8k to 16k - ideally
  I'd like to use a 64k buffer, but dcload does not have enough room for a
  larger decompression buffer - this helps to increase throughput at the
  higher bauds using a usb-serial based coders cable.
* added a time-to-transfer status line to dc-tool - e.g.:
    5.73 seconds to transfer 703023 bytes
* now compiles under current dc toolchain: gcc-3.4.1, binutils-2.15,
  newlib-1.12.0
* no need to burn a new dcload-serial boot cd. this version of dc-tool is
  compatible with dcload 1.0.3
 
WHATS NEW IN 1.0.3

* proper baudrate changing - dcload and dc-tool should always be compiled
  for 57600 now; use the -b option to switch to 115200 at runtime.
* experimental alternate 115200 setting - doesn't work for me, so please email
  andrewk@napalm-x.com if it works for you (especially if it works better than
  the default 115200).
* added O_BINARY to all open()s in dc-tool to help cygwin users
* included same IP.BIN (with logo/disclaimer) as found in dcload-ip. Please 
  use it if you distribute either cds or cd images.

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.2

* dc-tool supports loading elf and srec (in addition to raw bin)

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.1

* minor cleanup / bugfix

* new disclaimer screen (in target-src/1st_read)

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.0

* opendir(), closedir(), readdir() syscalls added

* lame cdfs redirection (-i <isofile> option to dc-tool) added

* -t <device> option to dc-tool added by Florian 'Proff' Schulze

* -b <baudrate> option to dc-tool added by The Gypsy
